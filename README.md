# mountenv
Features:
- extends [dotenv](https://npmjs.com/package/dotenv) functionality
- supports loading .env files under `CWD` or a specific directory
- auto loads `.env.dev` when `NODE_ENV === 'development'` (in addition)
- auto loads `.env.prod` when `NODE_ENV === 'production'` (in addition)

Note: this library is still under development stage and is being processed through heavy real-world battle testing. Full documentation will be released once this module is ready for alpha release.
